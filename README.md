# Expeditious Execution!!
A [FiveM](https://fivem.net/) freeroam server project to explore common snags encountered while developing a FiveM server.

## Running it
1. Make sure you've downloaded this repository's submodules, and your Git client supported symbolic links. This should be enabled by default on Git for Windows.
2. Set up private settings by copying server_private.cfg.sample to server_private.cfg and editing it with your [license key](https://keymaster.fivem.net/) and password.
3. Download the latest Windows [FXServer binaries](http://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/), extract them to any directory (without spaces), and run `run X:\path\to\fxs\directory` to start the server.
   Alternately, if you're more graphically minded, drag the FXServer directory to the run.cmd in this repository.
